# Chacal Idea  

Radar  
Collaborative  
Collect relevant descriptions and then generate statistics

***
## API (Go)
- Have to handle spam/rate limit
### Auth
- Verify user/password and provide JWT
### Post a new event
- Have to store this event on BDD and send result
- Allow anonymous events ??

***
## Client (JS)
### Auth
- Auth by login/password and store a JWT
### New event
- Store immediately coordonates if available
- Ask user to describe event
- Api POST event
- Get success
### Browse my recent events (if authenticated)

***
We have to get a system where collaborative users can view potential related events and note them
